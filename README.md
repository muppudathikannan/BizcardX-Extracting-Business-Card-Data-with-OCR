# BizcardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR

PROJECT SUMMARY

Bizcard Extracting with OCR is an application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.
The extracted information should then be displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI).
The application allows the users to save, modify, and delete the card details stored in database.

EasyOCR:

EasyOCR, is a Python package that allows computer vision developers to effortlessly perform Optical Character Recognition.
It is a font-dependent printed character reader based on a template matching algorithm.
It has been designed to read any kind of short text part numbers, serial numbers, expiry dates,
manufacturing dates, lot codes, printed on labels or directly on parts. EasyOCR currently supports 80+ languages.
We need to tell EasyOCR which language we want to read. EasyOCR can read multiple languages at the same time but they have to be compatible with each other.
